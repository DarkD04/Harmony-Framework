Changelogs for ?th of November 2024 (Version 1.0)
	This update might not (and probably won't) release in time for CGS, so apologies for that. Interesting that you did find the dev branch though..
	
    Player changes:
		-(TO-DO) Added Super Form support to all characters
		
	New features:
		-New level: Arboreal Agate 2, featuring new level design
		-Custom (and randomized) bridge example in Arboreal Agate
		-Example gimmick for swinging platforms
		-(TO-DO) Added special and bonus stage example
	
    Misc improvements:
		-Updated "obj_breakable_tile" to include new types from Sonic Mania
		-Background system updates:
			-Background system includes visibility flag, the "step" value in the line parallax is now global rather than relative to the scroll_x value, and added an example for a HCZ-like scaling water parallax!
			!!IMPORTANT!! Changes were done to the line parallax system and previously made parallax has to have its "step" value changed. Fortunately, you can simply use this formula for it: steps*(1-scroll_x)
			-Added a rudimentary BG switch based on the camera's potition rather than the player's

Changelogs for 21st of October 2024 (Version 0.9)
    I'll keep this brief and highlight only the most important changes made to the framework
    
    Utility scripts:
        -'object_collision_util' has been fully removed because now collision_util which was previously reserved for player only can be used on every object.
        -'animator_util' has been added for new animation system
        -'ease_util' has been added for new easing function, this one is not completely finished yet, it's lacking lots of different easing methods
        -'fade_util' has been edited to support different fade types, specifically white fade and new fuction 'fade_change' has been added for easy fade in and out
        -'player_util' has been added to modify stuff regarding the player
        -'music_util' has been added for new music engine
        -'camera_util' has been added for changing stuff regarding the camera
    
    Player changes:
        -Create event has been fully cleaned and every variable has been documented
        -Every script that is being called by the player has been updated
        -Both terrain and object collision recieved massive improvements and they are much more stable

        -Redone how floor mode chanes so moving on inverted half-pipes isn't jittery anymore

        -alpha_dither function has been added, which allows you to dither out the sprite
    
    New animation system:
        -New animation system is based on constructor, which allows you to use the animation system on everything you want and you can have multiple animators in one object
